# Hood guide
  Your first friend when moving to a new neighborhood

## Description
  I just moved and it's a little scary moving to a new nighborhood. You don't know which grocery stores to go to, which is the closest dry cleaner with the best reviews, what bar is recommended, movie theaters with the best picture, current events, etc. 
  
  There are many outlets to research this stuff. Honestly, I start with Google Maps :) I zoom in on the address and make judgments of the nearby businesses off of their name, and possibly street views. Sometimes I go further and look at yelp reviews of some of them, possibly filter news articles by area. Ultimately, it's a lot of work and doesn't really give me a clear view.
  
  I'd like to build an app that compiles all this info into one place, painting a slightly more clear picture of what the neighborhood's vibe will be and potentially give resources to find the most popular places. Ideally, users could post and share their favorite spots. Since I'm gearing it to newcomers, it would also provide a pseudo community for people to potentially meet other new comers.
